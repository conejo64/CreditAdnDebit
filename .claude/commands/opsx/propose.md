Propose a new change - create the change and generate all artifacts in one step.

I'll create a change with artifacts:
- proposal.md (what & why)
- design.md (how)
- tasks.md (implementation steps)

When ready to implement, run /opsx:apply

---

**Input**: The argument after `/opsx:propose` is the change name (kebab-case), OR a description of what the user wants to build.

**Steps**

1. If no input provided, ask what they want to build
2. Create the change directory via `openspec new change "<name>"`
3. Generate artifacts until apply-ready
